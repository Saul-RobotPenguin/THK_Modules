A community problem that I want to solve is food waste and hunger in NYC.
It's ironic that these two problem coexist within the city.
I want to develop an application that connects local restaurants with local
hungry New Yorkers. That way, I can create a situation in which two problems
are being combated. 

/*Brief Description of Application and it's features */

My application would connect with local restaurants that have extra food that they're
going to throw out. The time would be centeralized in the evening or night.
Where most business'es usually close down. The customer would get a notification
that there's food available nearby and would be at a first come, first serve basis.
Afterwards the restaurants would sent a notifcation saying No more Food Left.
My application won't be limited just to Restaurants but as well as locations
at FoodBanks and Food Pantries. Informing New Yorkers of alternative options 
if no Food is available.
